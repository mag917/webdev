		The idea of the meaning of an image being mostly transmittable, though imperfectly, interests me because as technology improves, we get ever closer to being able to achieve a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù reproduction, yet we will never truly reach it. Berger says that the stillness of a painting could not be transmitted. This is wholly true of the analog television technology of the era in which Ways of Seeing was produced, which uses a rapidly moving beam of electrons to illuminate phosphors on a screen. No image reproduced on an analog screen can be truly still, it merely appears to be still because our eyes aren‚Äôt fast enough to see the movement. <br><br>

		Modern digital screens, instead of using a single beam of electrons, have arrays of pixels which are immovable relative to each other, and in this way, a static digital image perhaps more closely approaches the stillness of a painting. And yet modern screens are also incapable of the same stillness of the original painting, because regardless of whether or not the image they display is moving, the display must be refreshed a certain number of times per second, usually somewhere between 60 and 240 frames per second. Every frame, the device controlling the screen must send a new signal telling the screen what to show, even if the image has not changed at all. <br><br>

	Because the technology of electronic image reproduction is so tightly linked to the reproduction and creation of moving images, rather than that of still images, the medium lends itself to the manipulation of still images into moving ones. Isolating certain parts of a larger painting, and displaying them one at a time, rather than simultaneously as they were on the original, distorts the viewer‚Äôs perception of the painting, and the order in which they are presented can have a great effect on what they remember as being important about the image. This gives vast amounts of control over the perception of a painting not to its creator, but to its reproducers.<br><br>

	This level of control increases when you add sound into the mix. What we hear is as important perceptually as what we see, and yet the technology to store and reproduce sound lagged far behind our ability to draw and paint visual imagery for much of human history. Today we can see a painting from Leonardo Da Vinci‚Äôs time as it was painted, assuming the painting was well-preserved, and yet to hear a song from that same era, exactly as it was played then, is impossible. The closest we can get is a modern musician interpreting the same sheet music. Even with an accurate reading of the sheet music, musical instrument design has changed, as has the pitch we tune our instruments to. Modern music standards almost universally define the note A above middle C as 440 hertz, or cycles per second, but as recently as a hundred years ago A was defined as 432Hz and before that it could have been as low as 395Hz in some places.  Despite their apparent permanence, compared to audio visual forms media can be changed just as easily as audio media over time. Paintings need to be restored, to varying degrees of accuracy, film degrades as well, and even digital media can become corrupted over time. I guess it‚Äôs just part of the nature of the universe, entropy dictates that nothing lasts forever, not even a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù image.
